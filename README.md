### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ (WIP)

Hi. My name is Marco Ollivier. 

I'm a Software Engineer focused on backend development. During my career, I created solutions based on Java, Golang, JavaScript, and Clojure technologies.

In 2019 I decided to get more involved in the Software Development Community and with two friends we redesigned the Golang users group in Rio de Janeiro city. 
The GopheRio Meetup was a great achievement for us and the developers community in Rio.

Currently, I'm working on [Nubank](https://www.nubank.com.br) as a Software Engineer.
